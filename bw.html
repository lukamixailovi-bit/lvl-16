<h1>black widow</h1>

<h2> Latrodectus </h2>

    <p>Latrodectus is a broadly distributed genus of spiders informally called the widow spiders
        , with several species that are commonly known as the true widows.
         This group is composed of those often loosely called black widow spiders, brown widow spiders, and similar spiders.</p>

         <p id = 'intro'>
             These small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin latrotoxin,
             which causes the condition latrodectism, both named after the genus.
              Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands, and their bite can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates,
               including humans. However, despite their notoriety, Latrodectus bites rarely cause death or produce serious complications
               .[citation needed] Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans.</p>



               <p id = 'venom'>
                 Due to the presence of latrotoxin in their venom,
                 black widow bites are potentially dangerous and may result in systemic effects (latrodectism) including severe muscle pain,
                  abdominal cramps, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and muscle spasms.[9] Symptoms usually last for 3 - 7
                   days, but may persist for several weeks.[10] In 1933, a University of Alabama medical faculty,
                    Allan Blair conducted an experiment on himself to document the symptoms of a black widow bite,
                     and to test whether someone can build immunity after being bitten.
                     [11] The effects of the bite were so painful and harsh that Blair failed to complete the experiment
                      and did not follow through with being bitten a second time.</p>



                      <p id = 'bites'>
                        n the United States each year, about 2,500[12] people report being bitten by a black widow,
                         but most do not need medical treatment. Some bites have no venom injected  a "dry" bite. In the United States,
                          a 2012 review by the American Association of Poison Control Centers found no deaths from black widows since 1983.
                          [13] Black widows are not especially aggressive spiders,
                           and they rarely bite humans unless startled or otherwise threatened.</p>



                                <p id = 'continent'> 
                                    Widow spiders are found on every continent of the world except <b>Antarctica.</b> In <b>North America,</b> the black widows commonly known as southern (Latrodectus mactans),
                                     western (Latrodectus hesperus), and northern (Latrodectus variolus) are found in the <b>united states</b>, equally in western <b>Mexico</b> (Latrodectus occidentalis),
                                      as well as parts of southern <b>Canada</b> - particularly in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, as are the "grey" or "brown widow spiders" (Latrodectus geometricus)
                                       and the "red widow spiders" (Latrodectus bishopi).[35]</p>
